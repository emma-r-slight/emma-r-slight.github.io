      <h1>What is neuroplasticity?</h1>
      <p>
        It was believed for many years that the adult brain was essentially
        fixed, that 'what you had was what you got’ and there was no changing
        it. As well as this belief, many people are under the illusion that they
        are not ’smart’ or intelligent enough to pursue an area of interest. Due
        to this people will avoid altogether or not put their all into learning
        a new skill or in the pursuit of academics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The study of the brain over the last 20 years and the discovery of
        Neuroplasticity has proven this belief to be a fallacy. Neuroplasticity
        is the the process by which your brain changes depending on what has
        happened to it. This relates to memory, learning, trauma and
        biomechanics. Our brains are essentially plastic that is constantly
        being reshaped through our daily experiences.

        As training and exercise is essential for athletes to develop muscle
        memory and muscle mass. Though learning and mental exercises you are
        developing the nerves in your brain. It has even been proven that mental
        practice has the same effects on the brain, effects the same pathways in
        the brain, as physical practise does. This is an example of
        neuroplasticity at work. Imagining yourself doing a task, helps to build
        stronger pathways, to cement that skill or memory firmly in the brain.

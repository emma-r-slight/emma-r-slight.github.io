      <h1>EQ vs IQ, What is the difference?</h1>
      <p>
        “Emotional intelligence or EI is the ability to understand and manage
        your own emotions, and those of the people around you. People with a
        high degree of emotional intelligence know what they're feeling, what
        their emotions mean, and how these emotions can affect other people.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence helps you build stronger relationships succeed in
        life, you career and personal goals. It enables you to be able to
        connect to your feelings, turn intention into action and make informed
        decisions about what matters most to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence is defined by four main attributes:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Self Management - You’re able to control your impulsive feelings and
          behaviours, manage emotions in healthy productive ways, follow through
          on commitments and adapt to changing circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Self Awareness - You recognise your own emotions and how they affect
          your thoughts and behaviour. You know your strengths and weaknesses,
          you have confidence in yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Social Awareness- You have empathy. You can understand the emotions,
          needs and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel
          comfortable socially, and recognise the power dynamics in a group or
          organisation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Relationship management- you know how to develop and maintain good
          relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work
          well in a team and manage conflict.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        IQ is a number derived from a standard intelligence test, Scores were
        originally calculated by dividing the individuals mental age by their
        chronological age then multiplied by 100. Iq represents the a persons
        ability in a number of fields
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
        <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
        <li>Working memory and short term memory</li>
        <li>Quantitative Reasoning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        EQ , is the measure of a person’s level of emotional intelligence.
        Referring to a person’s ability to perceive, control, regulate and
        express emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a high IQ will generally mean you will be successful in
        academics, you will be top of your class, get the best marks in school.
        To be successful in life and in the world outside of school you need
        high EQ. Researchers have shown that our success at work or in life
        depends on Emotional Intelligence 80% and only 20% of intellect. While
        our intellect help us to resolve problems, to make the calculations or
        to process information Emotional intelligence (EQ) allows us to be more
        creative and use our emotions to resolve our problems
      </p>
      <p>
        Our emotions(feelings) are important are they help you in a number of
        ways. They help with attention, memory and learning. Assist in making
        decisions, how we feel effects how we make decisions, they also
        influence our unconscious bias. (a teacher in a bad mood unknowingly
        marks a paper lower, than if they were in a positive frame of mind).
        Your emotions effect your relationships to people and products, whether
        you move towards a person/product is regulating by emotional signals.
        Your physical and mental health are impacted by your feelings, often
        creating a feedback loop, emotion feeding emotion causing depression in
        some cases. I have suffered from eczema my whole life, when I am under
        stress my eczema will flair up. Finally creativity, emotional skills
        related directly to how creative you are
      </p>
      <p>
        What I have learnt through this exercise is that being connected to your
        emotions, having the ability to regulate them, will help you and those
        around you. Becoming more conscious of your emotions in any given
        situation could only be beneficial moving forward. Knowing how you react
        to certain situations and consciously changing how you behave if
        necessary is a part of having good EI. Being able to recognise emotions
        in others and respond with empathy will help develop your relationships
        both at work and home. Awareness - is the key, of yourself and others!

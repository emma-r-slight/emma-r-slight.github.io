        My partner and I are looking at either buying or setting up a kiwifruit
        orchard. I’d like to be able use web development and data science To
        help track changes is the different parts of the orchard. Incorporating
        sensors that are available today and research in to soil science to
        incorporate regenerative ag ideas and concepts into an orchard
        environment.

        Completing this course will also allow me to have an income while
        working towards my goals.

        I used to quite a social person, working in Human Resources, talking to
        people came easy to me. I could start a conversation with anyone. Over
        that last few years due to a variety of circumstances I became quite
        isolated, I feel I’ve lost that ease I used to have dealing with and
        forming connections with people. I would like get my people skills back,
        network and learn to work as part of a team again.

        As I have mentioned in a previous post I love learning, but I have to be
        careful I don’t get lost “down the rabbit hole” when exploring and
        researching a topic. I am a prolific researcher, and I love nothing more
        than a good intellectual debate.

        I have been out structured employment for a number of years, helping my
        partner assisting my partner working on property. I no longer have a
        routine to my days. I need to establish some habits in my day, get up
        earlier (which is always difficult as I am no morning person!) and
        create a plan for what I want to achieve that day. I am hoping that by
        the time bootcamp starts the room I intend to work from is finished and
        I’ll have an area free of distractions. I’ve been using a Pomodoro
        planning app. So far it has worked well to remind me to take a break,
        but also plan my time for each task. I feel this part of the course,
        planning my time, actually sticking to it will be vital to getting me
        through the course work on time.
      </p>

        When I hit a roadblock during this course I will turn to my facilitator,
        the slack channel (foundations) or discord(boot camp) in order to get
        help from fellow students and teachers.

        I expect the team at Dev Academy to not solve a problem for me but to
        lead me towards it. Guiding my learning to areas I need to work on. I
        hope to establish a good relationship with the team at Dev and also with
        my Cohort. I feel that with the technology we have today this is
        possible even through remote learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only commitments I have during the day right now is making sure take
        my dogs outside a few times during the day.

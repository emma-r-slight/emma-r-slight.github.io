        <h1>Core Skills Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          Due the feeling directionless and disorganised for a long time, I had
          quiet doubts in the back of my head that I would be unsuccessful in
          organising my time, and getting tasks completed at all. I have been
          quite surprised that I can focus on a task, and stick to it without
          distraction. I have enjoyed having a sense of purpose again. That I
          can be somewhat organised and I am working towards establishing habits
          in meditation and journaling
        </p>
        <p>
          I honestly thought I might be faced with a moment where I would be so
          overwhelmed that I just give up rather than work through and keep
          going. The core skills and reflecting on my values and goals really
          grounded me and helped me find direction. Learning mindfulness has
          helped me become more aware, aware of others and how I interact with
          them and establish consistent communication with people in my life.
          Previously, totally unintentionally weeks would sometimes go by
          without contact with friends and family
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also learned that I haven’t lost my people skills as I had
          previously thought, through the listening and looping (which was a
          great task in itself) conversation came easily with complete
          strangers. This gave me confidence that I can have success with this
          course.

          Core skills so far has been an exploration of identity that at times
          has been difficult, but the concepts around reflection and learning
          have been eye opening. As I mentioned above It is early days yet, but
          I hope to establish a daily habit of reflecting in a journal. With the
          purpose to help with my education but also as a way to establish
          accountability, recording what I achieved that day and tracking goals
          I set for myself.

          Values, empathy and self awareness each play important roles in
          developing into a well rounded human being. Being self aware means
          recognizing one’s needs, values, judgments, and biases. Self awareness
          means being able to recognise the emotions of others, how what you are
          doing, how you are acting may effect those around you.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "Self-awareness allows us to see things from the perspective of
          others, practice self-control, work creatively and productively, and
          experience pride in ourselves and our work as well as general
          self-esteem (Silvia & O’Brien, 2004).”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Reflection is a part of being self aware and has also proven to be a
          valuable tool in education (and programming where you will never stop
          learning as code evolves over time). Reflecting on how you felt during
          activities, when you had success or failures, exploring why this or
          that happened, how it impacted you or those around you. Asking these
          questions of your self when reflecting helps your brain to establish
          strong pathways to memory as you explore a task from various angles.

          What surprised me most about the core learning was how challenging
          reflection could be. It was difficult at first to really explore my
          values and motivations, do I even have a culture? Identity? This deep
          dive into who I am was a rewarding experience in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning mindfulness was also a surprise. I had never done much
          exploration or really considered the benefits of meditation before
          now. I had always considered mediation a spiritual exploration or part
          of alternative culture previously. Now I am trying to make it part of
          my daily routine.

          Apart from these skills being vital to being a well rounded
          individual, they are essential to working in a team environment. They
          help you to develop healthy relationships and build a strong
          foundation, knowing who you are and what impact you want to have on
          the world.

          This part of the course has been invaluable to me, helping me find
          direction and purpose again. The topics explored each week have also
          been fascinating to learn about. Having a growth mindset is something
          I have always tried to have (whether I was always successful….?) and
          will try to keep in mind as I move forward with this course and in
          life. I definitely don’t see any of it as a waste of time

        <h1>Core Skills Reflection</h1>
        <p>
          Due the feeling directionless and disorganised for a long time, I had
          quiet doubts in the back of my head that I would be unsuccessful in
          organising my time, and getting tasks completed at all. I have been
          quite surprised that I can focus on a task, and stick to it without
          distraction. I have enjoyed having a sense of purpose again. That I
          can be somewhat organised and I am working towards establishing habits
          in meditation and journaling
        </p>
        <p>
          I honestly thought I might be faced with a moment where I would be so
          overwhelmed that I just give up rather than work through and keep
          going. The core skills and reflecting on my values and goals really
          grounded me and helped me find direction. Learning mindfulness has
          helped me become more aware, aware of others and how I interact with
          them and establish consistent communication with people in my life.
          Previously, totally unintentionally weeks would sometimes go by
          without contact with friends and family
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also learned that I havenâ€™t lost my people skills as I had
          previously thought, through the listening and looping (which was a
          great task in itself) conversation came easily with complete
          strangers. This gave me confidence that I can have success with this
          course.

          Core skills so far has been an exploration of identity that at times
          has been difficult, but the concepts around reflection and learning
          have been eye opening. As I mentioned above It is early days yet, but
          I hope to establish a daily habit of reflecting in a journal. With the
          purpose to help with my education but also as a way to establish
          accountability, recording what I achieved that day and tracking goals
          I set for myself.

        <h1>Exploring HTML, CSS and Javascript</h1>
        <h2>What are the differences between HTML and CSS?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML (Hyper-text markup language) is used to create the content on a webpage,
          the actual text written within the page.  CSS (cascading style sheet) id repsponsible
           for how that page will look, the design of the page....this includes the
           background-color, text size, and font sizing.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example from everyday life...</h2>
        <p>
          Control flow is the ordr in which a computer executes statements.
          Code usually runs from the first line to the last line.  This process can
          be interrupted and the order changed by the use of conditional statements (
          if...something happens, then do this, else do this...), or if there are loops
          written into the code.  Loops will repeat a set of instrustions(execute code)
          depending on the conditions within the loop statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          A comparison to this would be a truck driver who transports goods from Auckland
          to Christchurch, they follow a prescribed route everytime(code is executed),
           they have to make stops along the way, depending on the goods on the truck they
           stop detour to different towns along the way (conditional statements), at these
           stops goods are removed from the truck until the truck has delivered everything
           (loop, until condition met) on according to the manifest, they can then return
           to the prescribed route.
        </p>
        <h2>Describe the DOM & how you might interact with it...</h2>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model, referred to the DOM, is an essential part of making websites
          interactive.  It is an interface that allows a progtamming languages to manipulate content,
          structure and style of a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nodes and objects are organised in a tree like structure.  The head of the "tree",
          the trunk, is the window object, inside of this is the document object which is the
          "page" of the website. From this trunk, ojects branch off the tree, for example the
          body, which has divs, then h1 and p branching further.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can interact with the DOM using console log to test your code, or directly using
          Dev Tools in Chrome.  Using the developer tools in chrome you can manipulate a web page
          and making temporary changes to the styling,  you can also run scripts with the console
          feature.  This is often used when you are trying to debug your website or web app.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the difference beween accessing data from arrays and objects?</h2>
        <p>When accessing information in arrays you use indexing, all objects in arrays are numbered
          starting from '0'(being the first item/object in the array).  To access an item in the
          array you use the name of the array, followed by square box notationa and the number
          you wish to access in the array.  For example : myArray[6] will find the 7th item in the array.
        </p>
        <p>
          To access data from objects you use 'dot' notation or alternatively '[]' notation.  For
          example you have an object named person,  inside this object is  age: 35, name: Emma, etc.
          So to get inforamtion about person.  You can either do the following: myName = person.name()
           or myName = person[name].
        </p>
        <h2>What are functions and why are they useful?</h2>
        <p>
          A function is like a 'subprogram' within your program.  It consists of a sequence of statements.
          Values are passed to the function, and the function will returen a value.  A function is executed
          whenever it is "called" within your programme, as many times as required.  Calling a function
          requires a number of parameters (called arguements), arguments are passed to functions as a value
          and return a value once the code is executed within the function.

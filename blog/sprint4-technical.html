      <h1>Problem Solving and Me</h1>
      <h2>The time I was blocked on a simple problem...</h2>
      <p>
        I was trying to get my home/index page set up for my blog. My plan was
        to have a simple plain header with my name in the centre and have
        underneath it boxes for each blog entry set up in a grid. For the life
        of me I could not work out what was wrong with my code. I visited uncle
        google, many times, referred back to the course information about CSS
        grid, I even tracked down the CSS dev website…. Still couldn’t work it
        out, the grid-gap, wasn’t working, it just wouldn’t set up the grid!! I
        was rather frustrated at this point!! I had read through my code a
        number of times by then, but I did so again… and there it was a missing
        “-“ in “auto-fit”. I fixed the typo and hey presto….problem fixed!!
      </p>

      <h2>The time I solved a problem elegantly (kind of)...</h2>
      <p>
        When we were doing the Katas I worked my way to the Olympic level event.
        For the second task we were required to simply add a new person object
        to an array with relevant properties. We didn’t need to write a function
        for the task, but to challenge myself I did.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew how to create an object with a list of properties, how to call
        the function with arguments…. I wasn’t sure on how to add the new
        “person” to the array, each time the function was called.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t know whether how I solved the problem would be considered
        elegant. Through reading all the information available on MDN about
        objects and functions, and looking at examples of the code in action. I
        came up with a way to solve the problem that was new to me. Using
        ‘.push’ to add the person to the array and then calling new‘person’
        followed by the arguments all in one line (after writing a function
        ‘person’ with the objects properties established.
      </p>

      <h2>How I feel about using different problem solving techniques..</h2>
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        I use this when faced with a complex problem, I map out the steps that I
        will use to solve it. I like to use pen and paper and write a sentence
        in plain English for each step/part, breaking down the problem into
        smaller, manageable problems Each sentence describing what the code will
        do as you work through it.
      </p>
      <h3>Try something...</h3>
      <p>
        I am not one to prevaricate when faced with a coding problem, I will try
        out anything that comes to mind, in an attempt to solve the problem…. I
        am not one who works on a problem and then stops if it doesn’t work the
        first time. I try and try again!!
      </p>
      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>
        Not something I resort too often, usually only when I am writing
        letters, essays …or blog pages. I use it to check whether I have missing
        words or horrific grammar!! I read through what I’ve written out load…
        to no one in particular… and pick up errors along the way.
      </p>
      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>
        This new to me. So early days, but once I move on from the “dam” didn’t
        work moment…. This will be handy moving forward, pointing out where I
        may have gone wrong..
      </p>
      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
      <p>
        I made great use of this, this sprint. Still a new tool in my problem
        solving toolbox. Will have to explore more and learn how to make full
        use of console.logging in writing tests etc
      </p>
      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>
        Google is my friend, I am never too far from a browser to answer to
        questions of life, how to kill weeds with salt, find the nearest vet or
        how to use methods with strings and arrays in Javascript. Once I
        mastered the skill of googling many years ago, I haven’t stopped.
      </p>
      <h3>Asking peers for help...</h3>
      <p>
        So far, I have turned to slack to ask for help and suggestions around
        various aspects of the foundations course. Even just for support, to
        know that yep others have struggled, are struggling through the same as
        you!!
      </p>
      <h3>Asking coaches for help...</h3>
      <p>
        So far, I have been able to resolve any issues myself, but when I
        encounter a problem that I’m totally stuck on, can’t me forward on. I
        will definitely turn to our facilitators for help.
      </p>
      <h3>Improving my process through reflection...</h3>
      <p>
        This is also a new tool that I’ve only recently learned of the benefits
        of. So far (when I remember) I feel it is beneficial to my learning, it
        definitely helps to absorb new information. I haven’t established a
        habit around reflection, writing in a journal daily as of yet. This is
        something I would like to add to my day

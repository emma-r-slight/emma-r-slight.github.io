        <h1>Values, Strengths and Identity</h1>
        <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>For the first 5-6 years of my life it was just my father and I. My Mother had passed suddenly and he was left with a 15month old to raise.   These early years with just the two of us helped me to develop into a rather independent child, one who was always curious about the world and the people around her.  My family always used to call me “Mrs Why and What For”, my desire for knowledge and understanding of everything around me was insatiable (and still is!).  There is always something to learn, understanding how we as humans influence and effect the environments we live in, is fascinating to me.   My head is often full of questions, trying to visualise systems and patterns, reasons something is behaving or reacting in a particular way</p>
        <p>In times of stress or conflict, I will most often react with logic rather than emotion.  My friends and family often turn to me in times of crises as I help them gain reason and understanding in any given situation.  The COVID 19 pandemic is a great example,  a very close friend of mine called me in the early days of the lock down.  She was feeling overwhelmed, panicking, but by the end of our conversation, where all I did was explain to her everything that I knew about the virus at that point,  she was calm.   She knew that I could give her the facts as I knew them.</p>
        <p>My (step)Mum is like a force of nature, she was a kindy teacher when Dad met her and she’s one of those people born to be teachers.  She’s the opposite of Dad flamboyant, creative, loves to dress up for halloween (or to embarrass you at the airport) and is accepting of everyone no matter who you are or where you are from.  She has passed this one to me, respecting others and celebrating our differences, yet welcoming what connects us is one of my core values.</p>
        <p>I value family, community and the environment.  Having empathy for your fellow human beings and understanding that, you may not like it but there is always two sides to a story.</p>
        <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
        <p>I love learning!! One of my greatest fears is one day not being able to learn new information for one reason or another.   I have always known that the only obstacle to my own success is me.  This has at various times actually hindered me, I’ve been overwhelmed by choice, trying to decide what I wanted in life and been paralysed by it.  Fear of failure, of not living up to my own expectations is also something I’ve wrestled with in the past.

            With perseverance, hard work and commitment I can achieve what ever I set out to do.

            In terms of career development,  I feel my life has been in limbo for far too long.  It’s like I’ve been bobbing around in an ocean with no rudder, no purpose or direction, waiting for someone to come a long and save me.  Well that wasn’t going to happen. I made the decision to take this course, take on a student loan (again), this is me deciding to get an outboard motor and driving in a direction of my own choosing. </p>
        <h2>dentify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
        <p>My ability to be calm when faced with stress will be vital when facing obstacles.  I know that the answer is there somewhere, I just need to remember to take a step back, to a take moment and then come back with a fresh perspective.  As for facing moments of self doubts, I will reach out to one of my close friends, who is always there when I need to be told “Ems you got this, stop being stupid, get to work!!”</p>
        <h2>An example where you experienced conflict/tension/resistance when working in team, and how you dealt with the situation.</h2>
        <p>I faced many situations where there has been tension or resistance in the team.  These are often the result of terrible management practices or unprofessional attitudes.  I’ve worked in the customer service for many years in a variety of roles, stress and a breakdown in the system is a common cause of conflict and tension in a team. </p>
        <p>When there’s deadlines looming or its the busiest day of the day  of the year people often become overwhelmed and it will take only one small breakdown, error, someone to mislabel something…… for conflict to erupt.  Days like that are a powder keg waiting to erupt.  The way I handle them is to “keep calm and carry on”.  You take on one task at a time, support the other members of the team where possible, and try not to let the situation escalate by getting frustrated yourself.</p>
        <p>I’m not sure how I would handle some of those situations differently today, probably with more awareness of others.  Make sure if you know its a busy time of year make sure I am (that everyone is) organised and prepared before hand.  </p>
